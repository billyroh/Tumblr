# Show and tell

* Tab bar should be implemented as a view with 5 buttons.

* Implement the 4 tabs (Home, Search, Account, and Trending) as scrollviews that contain screenshots.

* When not on the search tab, the explore popover should appear and bounce.

* Tapping "Log in" from the Home page should show the login form.

* Compose button should show the various post buttons without animation.

* Optional: Try to imitate the animation effect of the real app.
